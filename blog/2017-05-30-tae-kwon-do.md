This week is our first week of classes here in Mexico! We're enrolled in a Tae Kwon Do class which starts at 8AM, super early for me. The class is an hour and a half long. Since normally I'm not one to do much physical exercise this has been a lot of effort to get started. I feel goofy with my kicks because I can't really stretch my leg out the way everyone else does. I haven't memorized the exercises that we do in the morning so I feel a little awkward running through those trying to copy what the others are doing, but I have a feeling I'll get the hang of this with more time.

Jessica tells me that the first two weeks of it are the worst, because your body will be so resistant, but afterwards it gets much better. I think I've already felt a little more energy throughout the day from taking the class in the morning. Directly afterwards I have a Spanish class which is 5 hours long and I am able to keep attention for the entire class.

I worry for Josh since this is his first Spanish class and they told us it'd be more split up. This level is much harder than the class at OSU because there is no English at all. Spanish, taught in Spanish. We've done different exercises like writing a story in basic sentences (present tense). We also have a paper due each week where we should read a book or article in spanish and write a one-page report about it.
