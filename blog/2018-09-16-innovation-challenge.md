This past weekend was very exciting. About two months ago I was notified that I had been chosen to participate in the ConocoPhillips innovation challenge. I remember that I was so excited to get that news seeing as they had mentioned there would be job opportunities and prizes for attending.

However, I didn't know that neither of those were the real prize until this weekend. I drove out to Bartlesville and arrived at my hotel, ready to participate in the challenege.

I met lots of people that night, we did tons of ice breakers and everyone started to warm up to each other. The atmosphere was welcoming. I felt pretty comfortable right away, and knew that I was surrounded by kind, driven people.

The next day came and we were headed over to the ConocoPhillips building at 8 AM. I chose to join a team that was with three other guys,two of them from Management Science and Information Systems, and one of them a fellow Computer Science major from OSU. Although, I had never met him before.

Our task was to use the Intel RealSense Depth camera to create an augmented reality drilling platform control system (like a big oil drill). We were able to use an SDK called the [Nuitrack SDK](https://nuitrack.com/) to get skeleton data. We used Unity as our physics engine and user interface for the system.

Coming into this challenge was an immense learning curve, none of us besides the other student from OSU had ever used Unity. I had only barely glanced at C# code before this. We spent the first 6 hours or so just reading APIs and watching tutorials about Unity. We had two mentors that were a great help in giving us the pushes we needed and after we got our feet wet, we didn't look back.

By the end of two days, we were all very comfortable working together, we had created a proof of concept prototype which I was proud to present to the judges. While I know that given more time we could really have taken this project so much further, I am so grateful for the amount that I learned in this short time.

I feel more excited than ever for the future right now. I believe I can truly learn anything, and with a willing and eager team, can get anywhere.

My team came from a varied background, and we all had different strengths. However, we all broke through from being strangers to being comrades in a very short amount of time. I felt confident with my team members and we were all constantly teaching each other how to do things. That learning experience alone was all that I could ask for from the weekend.

However, the people at ConocoPhillips were too nice to let use just walk away with the learning experience.

The project that we presented earned us third place and all of us earned a large cash prize. We also got to keep the Intel cameras that we used on the project, which I already have plans to use in the future.

I am thankful to both ConocoPhillips and to the people on my team who helped me learn so much over this past weekend, I hope that the teams I work on in the future will yield similar experiences.

I would love to hear about programming contests that you might have participated in and if it was a similar experience or not, you can reach me below or by email at [michael@giraffesyo.io](mailto:michael@giraffesyo.io)
