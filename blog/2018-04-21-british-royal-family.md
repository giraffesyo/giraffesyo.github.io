During my Understanding World Cultures class, I found it very interesting how big the British Royal Family was when one of the girls in the class presented over it. I checked it out online and found this chart on Khan Academy:

Interestingly enough, there is a Khan Academy article which talks about Route-Finding. That is, using computer search algorithms to find the shortest chain of people connecting two members of the royal family. In their example, they wanted to find the shortest path from Prince William to William III. This type of algorithm is something that I might analyze the time-complexity of in my Analysis and Design of Algorithms class that I'm taking this semester. It was amusing to find a connection like this between two such different classes, albeit in a very unexpected way.

If you'd like to read more about this, the full Route-Finding article is available on [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/algorithms/intro-to-algorithms/a/route-finding). It gives a brief and very shallow look at this deep topic article and should be easy to read for all audiences.
