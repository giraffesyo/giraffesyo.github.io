This semester was an awfully busy one. I ended up taking five classes:

- Analysis and Design of Algorithms
- Understaning World Cultures
- Probability and Statistics for Engineering
- Numerical Methods for Engineers
- Interactive Design

For me, this was a very full load and I did my best to keep up despite the different instruction methods at Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey.

At Oklahoma State University, most of the points are awarded for results on the exams and the rest are divided up among the homeworks.

However, at Tec, they are very project happy and each class tends to assign at least one major project. Numerical Methods though, assigned four. I believe all of these projects has made a big impact on me.

Now that it's over, I realize that because of these projects, I was put into a lot of situations that I wouldn't have otherwise found myself in.

For instance, I feel a lot more confident about making teams with my classmates. Perhaps the fact that people in Mexico City are very friendly helped boost my confidence in this regard.

## _". . . I feel like people are genuinely happy to see you"_

Whether you're meeting someone for the first time or seeing them for the fifth time that day, people always greet with either a handshake or a kiss on the cheek. This was a bit of a culture shock at first, because of the distant culture we maintain in the United States. However, after I was used to it, I actually prefer these warm greetings. I feel closer to my classmates and I feel like people are genuinely happy to see you, instead of that indifferent feeling that you feel when walking into a classroom in the United States.

## _". . . I think that this culture can be brought back with me"_

I already spoke to Josh about it, that I'd like to start being this very charismatic character, walking into a classroom and shaking hands with the people I've met. I think that this culture can be brought back with me, and that even if I'm considered a bit weird, it will help me to start conversations with people whom perhaps I would never have met otherwise.

# The people I've met

Within the first weeks of starting each class, I met several friends who I hope to stay in touch with in the future. The people I met come from a diverse background, from all across Mexico and from all different majors. It would be so nice if our future work somehow brings us together again. I cherish the connections that I've made during this past year, and think that these connections, over everything, are the most valuable resource that I have gained from studying abroad.

I've met memorable people in each one of my classes. I heard before coming to Mexico that the majority of study abroad students only become friends with other foreign exchange students. However, while I met many foreign exchange students and have become close friends with some of them, I found that the majority of the friends I have made in Mexico are Mexican.

No matter where my future takes me, I hope that I can always bring a bit of Mexico with me.
