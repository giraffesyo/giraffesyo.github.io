summary: In video game development, the hello world of 3D games is rolling a ball around the screen. In this post, I go over moving that into Augmented Reality with Unity and the Vuforia SDK.

# Summary

In this post, I'll be walking through the steps needed to create a roll-a-ball augmented reality (AR) game in Unity.
We'll be using the Vuforia SDK in order to accomodate the AR piece of this tutorial.
Vuforia and Unity are both free to get started with developing, so there won't be any costs to go through this post.

As a bonus, we're going to add some coins that you can pick up with the ball.

# Prerequisites

In order to get started, you'll need to have the following:

- Unity 3D  
  For installing Unity, I recommend downloading [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download). It makes it easy to install new versions of Unity when they are released.  
  Once you have Unity Hub installed, install a recent version of Unity using the hub.
- Vuforia SDK
  You can create a free Vuforia account at [Vuforia](https://developer.vuforia.com/), once you have an account, download the [Unity Package](https://developer.vuforia.com/downloads/sdk)
- Turobsquid account (optional)
  In order to get a free 3D model, I'm going to use Turbosquid. However, you can just use primitive shapes to complete this tutorial.

# Creating a Vuforia Image Target

Per the Vuforia [docs](https://library.vuforia.com/features/images/image-targets.html), image targets represent images that Vuforia can detect and track.

> The Engine detects and tracks the image by comparing extracted natural features from the camera image against a known target resource database.

  <p className='w-2/3 ml-4'>
    Vuforia has an online tool called the Target Manager which uses their cloud
    to generate that database so we can use it with the SDK. The type of
    augmented reality we are going to be doing depends on having an object in
    the real world that we can use as a "target". The Vuforia SDK will apply
    computer vision techniques in order to recgonize that target and then that
    will be the base of our 3D environment. To get started, we need an object in
    the real world and a good picture of that object. I chose to use my U.S.
    passport because it was sitting on my desk and seemed somewhat generic. It's
    easy to find a high resolution image of a passport, so I went out to google
    and grabbed one.

After you have your object and a picture of it:

1. Open the [Target Manager](https://developer.vuforia.com/vui/develop/databases)
2. Choose Add Database
3. Give it any name, HelloWorld works fine. For type, choose "Device"
4. Click on the newly created database to open its detail page
5. Choose Add Target
6. Leave Single Image Selected
7. For width, this is technically meant to represent meters, but Unity physics calculations for objects as small as a passport can get a little strange, so for demo purposes put a number like `3` here.
8. Choose Add

After a moment, it will show you a rating. This score represents how well Vuforia expects to be able to track the image.

Finally, download the database, choosing Unity Editor when prompted, and we can continue on to Unity.

# Creating the Unity 3D project

I'm assuming that you've already installed Unity Hub. The first thing that we need to do is create an empty project in Unity.

1.  Open the hub and click new
2.  Choose 3D from the available templates
3.  Give your project a name, Hello World works fine, and click create
