            <p>
              I'm a Computer Science student at Oklahoma State University. I
              spent the last year studying my major abroad in Mexico City,
              Mexico. The experience helped me broaden my horizons as a denizen
              of the world while learning Computer Science from the most
              prestigious school in Mexico.
            </p>
            <p>
              My experiences have been varied, from technical support to helping
              people with fraud at Apple iTunes. Now, I'm finally doing what I
              love, learning to code!
            </p>
            <p>
              I have found that as a programmer, I am solving new problems every
              day. Because of this, work really feels like a game where I just
              have to find the answer to the current level, and when you reach a
              level you've already beaten, the answer is ever so clear.
            </p>
            <p>
              Over the summer I did a software development internship at
              Foundation Software in Strongsville, Ohio. Now, I'm back in
              classes and expect to graduate May 2019.
