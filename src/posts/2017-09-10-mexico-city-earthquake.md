It wasn't very late but I had fallen asleep early. I woke up to Jessica's mom yelling her name over and over and the howling of alarms off in the distance. There were no lights. Jessica said there was an earthquake and began to ran downstairs as I got up, still in an unaware, just-awoken state. I went over into the next room to grab shoes and saw the dresser rocking back and forth as if it was about to fall over. The house was shaking so much I had trouble standing. I walked to the stairs and each step I felt like I was taking a step off a boat, or walking through a fun house. The staircase was shaking so much it was surely going to collapse after each step I took.

I could hear the sound of windchimes, chiming loudly as if being battered by a gale. But there was no wind, and the windchimes were in the middle of the room where no breeze ever reached. They were sounding so violently merely from the shaking of the house. I was calling Jessica's name, unsure where she went. No response. I saw her parent's bedroom door open and thought of times when I've been in tornados people often hid in the bathroom. I decided not to check and went down the stairs more. I reached the main floor and saw that the front door was open.

I proceeded out of the door and again noticed the giant door where the cars enter was open. I made my way down the entrance steps and out of the house. Jessica was across the street and ran to get me, afraid that the transformer above would fall any moment.

I was safe.

We were jumpy at the next few earthquake alerts that we witnessed but I haven't felt any strong quakes like that. For living in Oklahoma, where we allegedly have more earthquakes than any other place in the world, that was the strongest earthquake I had ever witnessed.
