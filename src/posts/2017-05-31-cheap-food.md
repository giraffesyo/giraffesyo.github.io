Good news about campus is theres many places to eat, and there food is pretty cheap. I tried a bolognesa dish from the italian restaurant and it was pretty good! Only complaint is that although the bread was free itÂ pretty burnt.

All of this was like $3.50![IMG_4414.JPG](https://mcquadeblog.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/img_4414.jpg?w=3724)
