I was at school to work on my robot vision partial exam. It began to rain like every other day and then I started to hear a loud noise in the background. Josh asked me what it was and I said it sounded like a vacuum.

A few moments later some Mexican students approached us and told us in English that it was the seismic alarm and the we had to leave the classroom we were studying in. Josh and I left, we didn't know what to do in the case of earthquake so we waited with a big group of people that were standing around until the siren stopped. The rain continued and continued. Eventually we overheard that the high school building was flooded once again. We went to check and sure enough, the bottom floor, called the "ciber", was flooded about ankle deep in water. There was no electricity in the high school building.

Josh and I tried repeatedly over the next hour to order an uber in order to leave campus but one-by-one they cancelled the trips and sent messages about how it was impossible to reach Tec at that time. Tec should have been closing soon, but there still seemed to be hundreds of people there. No one had left.

We walked around the campus and saw that even Pam, the director of international programs was at the campus still. She told us that nobody was able to leave because the area was flooded and no cars could get to Tec.

Josh and I decided to continue to study and we ended up being at Tec until around 1 AM when everything started to drain away.

It was a weird feeling to be at the campus that late. Even though we're often at OSU in Stillwater all night, sometimes until classes start the next day, we had never been allowed to remain in Tec past 10:30 and it had a strange feeling to accompany it. So many people were gathered together in the Salon of Congress and were listening to music, some people sleeping on the floor, some watching movies on TVs in the corners. Felt so strange that I still had an exam due the next day while all this was happening.
