Had my first experience four wheeling today! Went out with Jessica, Josh, and Jessica's parents. It was about an hour out of the city, it was nice though! We were on a closed dirt track. I wasn't confident enough to go very fast at first but as I rode more around the track I built a little confidence to give some gas. Although, I have to say it was nothing compared to Josh who was lapping Jessica and I constantly. Jessica's parents just sat and watched us while we rode.

Before we rode we ate at a small restaurant at the track. They used blue/green corn so the tortillas are a different color than normal. There was also horses there but we didn't have time to go riding on them! Had tons of fun! :)
