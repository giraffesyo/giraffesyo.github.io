The following is an assignment for world cultures class I'm in:

> "you could see noodles popping in and out of existence, like the tangled roots of the ever-absent-from-my-life ramen-tree"

"Careful, that’s hot!” Said the waiter as she placed the bowl in front of me.

The waiter was wearing a kimono and the atmosphere of the restaurant felt very homey. The way I was greeted upon entering the restaurant felt as if I had just returned home from a long day of work, this place is where I belonged at that moment.

I attempted to look at what she had set in front of me. I couldn’t immediately focus on the contents because of the steam piping off of the top of the liquid, blurring my eyes. The familiar and welcome sensation of spice reached my nose. My mouth instantly started to water as neurons fired in my brain, I was remembering this warm feeling of tasty ramen.

My eyes focused onto the bowl of soup the waiter had set down and I could see the creamy brown broth taunting me.

_Eat me, Eat me!_

### **A simple, but masterful composition**

Three strips of lean pork belly were placed neatly on top of each other, cascading over the right side of the bowl, half-submerged in the broth. The other portion of the bowl you could see noodles popping in and out of existence, like the tangled roots of the ever-absent-from-my-life ramen-tree.

### **A faraway desire**

Oh, how I wish for a bowl at this moment, the hint of curry flavor, the spicy but not-too-spicy broth, the perfectly cooked egg, the soggy seaweed slightly submerged in soup, all waiting to find its home in my belly. All of the world happens to disappear for me in those moments before I take my first bite. The anticipation builds up, my blood pressure most probably rises from the mere excitement of pure, rameny ecstasy, and the moment of impact is completely worth every moment I waited for this bowl to arrive.

> "he instantly regretted it after having the feeling of its feelers feeling around"

Sometimes, I’ve found myself waiting an hour to eat this delicious delicacy. I’m always in good company however. For instance, I brought my friend [Chad](https://twitter.com/Eublar) one time, and he recognized the ramen reality that is my love. He even dared to try some cooked octopus, another odd dish served at this hidden gem restaurant. He didn’t know at the time that it was actually octopus he was eating, so even though he thought it tasted great, he instantly regretted it after having the feeling of its feelers feeling around in his stomach. However, his qualms were calmed when his bowl of curry ramen came to.

### **Plenty to eat! _itadakimasu_**

The bowls that the soup come in are broad and deep, holding plenty of content, leaving you satisfied when you chance upon the bottom. Leaving the restaurant you feel like you’re departing into a colder world, a world with less to be there for.

Have you tried any delicious ramen, or Japanese food? I really enjoyed this place in Stillwater. I know about another place in Tulsa, that I might share with you in the future!

Stay tuned!
