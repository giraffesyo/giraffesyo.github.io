The following is an assignment for a world cultures class I’m in. I was required to take note of the technology in two markets near the school:

We took two field trips within our world cultures class to go see two very different markets, Mercado Villa Lázaro Cárdenas and [Paseo Acoxpa](http://paseoacoxpa.com/). The first one we visited, is more at home with what I thought a market in Mexico would look like before I actually came.

## Mercado Villa Lázaro Cárdenas

![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/ivmoJ.jpg)Owing to the fact that it was located inside a two-story building, it's not quite a _tianguis,_or street market, but it had quite a similar feel to it. There was definitely technology within the market, but not what'd you normally think of when that word comes to mind.

Electronics were scarce within the market. From a single old TV setup, a microwave, a stereo that looked like the one my mom used to teach skating classes with 15 years ago, and the lights inside the building and a few other random electronics, most of the tech here was for manual use.![](https://i.stack.imgur.com/TFBYR.jpg)

As an example, the more frequently seen technology within the market included meat grinders, sinks, knives, baskets, scales, plastic chairs, and gas stoves.

The first level was mostly a market to buy various things such as fruit, meat, piñatas, and the outside housed a convenience store of sorts which sold chips, sodas, and ice cream.

The second level, however, was of more interest to me. Upstairs housed an open room full of tables. Along the walls were a variety of different stalls that each were like mini-restaurants. They had their own menus posted and it all smelled very delicious. We didn't stop to eat that day, but I hope to go back in the future and try out something! Each stall had their own flat-top griddle and some had deep fryers. Most of the food was Mexican in nature but there was one sushi restaurant as well. A couple of the people working the stalls also had TVs setup for their entertainment when business was slow.

The building itself had recently been painted, as the last time I had seen it the outside was purple and now it had been replaced by a green and yellow paint-job. There was no parking lot or structure, most people visiting the market seemed to be walking in by foot.  It seemed to me that the customers were most likely local to the market itself.

# Paseo Acoxpa

Sitting cater-cornered from that market, there was another market. While we can use the term market to describe both, there is where the similarities end.

Enter, Paseo Acoxpa, a modern shopping mall.

The technology seen within Paseo Acoxpa _is_ what the average person thinks of nowadays when that word is thrown around.

Modern electronics are everywhere. The kiosks have employees who are using tablets. The cash registers are touch screen devices. There are screens with advertisements in the walkways. Some of the fast-food restaurants in the food court give you buzzers to let you know when your order is ready.

Perhaps most novel of all is the gigantic television mounted over the food court which usually has sports playing on it. The TV is massive, stretching wider than the fast-food restaurant it is mounted above.

### _People brought together because of technology . . ._

A soccer match for the world cup was playing on the TV during my visit and upon a goal being scored the entire courtyard erupted into cheer. It was an impressive idea, everyone united because of the results shown on that huge screen.

The technology within Paseo Acoxpa deeply contrasts that of the market we visited prior. If something could be electronic, it was. Hardly anything was intended for manual use.

It is interesting that both of these markets are within such close proximity, and both represent Mexican culture in their own ways, but they are both so different. The people that were visiting the market were mostly older people, and the people in Paseo Acoxpa were generally younger.

Is this new type of market the way of the future for Mexico?
