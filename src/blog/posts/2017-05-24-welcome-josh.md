After picking Josh up from the airport we headed to the apartment we were going to rent.

It wasn't possible to fit the car down the street we would live on, so Jessica and her family dropped us off at a nearby street where we could walk to the apartment. I had already texted Lizbeth, the girl managing the apartment while the owner Magaly was in France. She was waiting for us at the end of the street next to a giant metal red door. The street was very narrow, only room enough for small cars to fit, and there were small cars lined up on the side of it all the way down. One side of the street is lined with building, mostly houses but some appear to be businesses of sorts from the noises heard within. Walking past one such place I can hear the noise of paint being sprayed, and there are giant metal doors, I assume they are painting cars. The other side of the street is a giant stone wall, which is shutting off access to a soccer field. Half-way down the street built into the wall is a catholic shrine.

When we reached Lizbeth she asked us if we wanted to do the paperwork now or later after we ate. We were both hungry but wanted to go ahead and get everything out of the way. Jessica's mom had given us Pesos in exchange for USD, thankfully, and we wanted to give that money to Lizbeth as soon as possible so we didn't have a chance to lose it. For the first months rent and our deposit we had to pay 7000 pesos each, which was 388 USD. The deposit is a full months rent and it covers any damages we cause. We should get it back later.

After setting our stuff down, Lizbeth says something about how there was a problem due to the rain and the lights on the streets are out. She left to go print the contracts out. We immediately noticed that there was no power and I started to wonder if maybe I didn't quite understand what she meant correctly. I sent her a text and it turns out, she meant that there was no power in the whole street because of some rain the day before. I asked her where she was and she said she was at an office. I asked if we could charge our phone and she came back to get us. We followed Lizbeth to an office a few streets away from where we lived. The office didn't look like much from the outside, it was a building painted in an intense blue color. We walked inside and were in a room with a desk, Lizbeth told us to go upstairs to do the contracts and we walked through a door into a much bigger room with cement floors. We walked upstairs and into another room above the one we were just in. The room had a big table like you'd see in a movie where board members would sit around. Except the chairs were all different types and Josh broke one when he sat down. We didn't let her know, just kept that secret. We reviewed the contracts, signed, gave her the money, got a receipt and stayed there to charge my phone since there was no power still at our apartment. After getting my battery some charge, we both wanted to get some food.

I really wanted to take Josh to a restaurant I had been to several times, but we also needed to get him phone service. We Ubered over to Jessica's house and walked with her to AT&T. It was a really long wait, the entire store was filled with people waiting for help. Once we were able to get help Josh got an amazing deal on phone service. 200 USD for an entire year with unlimited data per month to be used on social networks (Facebook, Messenger, Snapchat, Instagram, Uber, Twitter) and 5.5GB on all other data, plus unlimited roaming and calls to Mexico, United States, and Canada. There is no way you can get a plan like that in the United States, so I was amazed. The plan I had gotten at AT&T in Mexico was pretty good, but since he signed a year contract he got a much better deal. I paid 40$ for two months of service, with only 3GB of data, but I didn't know about that plan when I signed up. I will probably end up switching to that same plan once the two months I paid for are over.

After we got done with getting service, it was already about 7 PM.  Jessica, Josh, and I walked to La Casa de Toño, a Mexican food restaurant which sells great sopes and fried quesadillas. The quesadillas there, despite the name, don't come with cheese unless you ask for it. So far, this is my favorite restaurant in Mexico City. I really love the taste of the food, and the speed of the service. I ordered us a couple sope's and some quesadillas. We also all had a michelada.

After that, we returned home and retired. There was no power so there was nothing left to do. Lizbeth said that the power should be back on that night or the next morning. I plugged my phone into my laptop and let it drain the rest of my laptops battery overnight so I could have some power the next day.
