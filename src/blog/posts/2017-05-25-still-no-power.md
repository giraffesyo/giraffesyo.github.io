After waking up, I immediately realized there was still no power in the apartment. I got out of bed at around 10 or 11 AM. Josh was still sleeping but I woke him up. We both started unpacking our bags into our closets. We were both pretty hungry since neither of us had eaten anything since La Casa de Toño. Jessica recommended that we try to go to Acoxpa, an outdoor mall nearby. We walked to Acoxpa, a straight shot down the street and decided to eat McDonalds.

This was my first time fully ordering without Jessica's help. I didn't quite get it right either, proof of my failure was that I ordered 2 mcdoubles without onions and 2 mctrio meals (basicaly a mcdouble with an extra piece of meat). Instead of getting 4 burgers and two sets of drink and fries, we got 3 burgers, a mctrio and two mcdoubles, and three drinks and three fries. Well, pretty close, but I went back and ordered the extra burger we wanted.

The burgers from McDonalds are pretty close to the taste in US, but the meat is a little bit different. While we were eating we didn't see a place to charge our phones, but after we finished we looked more and found a table in the food court next to an outlet in the ground. We both charged our phones to about 30% while talking and watching reruns of the world cup that were being played on a giant television. Josh said a television like that would probably cost about 8 million dollars, wow.

I ordered us 2 chocolate dipped cones from Dairy Queen and after finishing those we decided to go a Best Buy thats located in Acoxpa. Josh is still employed there so we wanted to see if he could use his employee discount there. We went inside and noticed immediately how expensive electronics were. Some video games were 90$, and the Nintendo Switch instead of 299$ was 555$ after conversion from pesos. I asked someone if we could use the register to check employee discount and he said no, and brought me over to a manager. The manager spoke English and asked about it, we told him Josh was an employee in the United States and if he could get the discount. They told us yes. He said it was 10% here in Mexico, which is crazy because the discount is so much better in the United States. We told him about the US discount but I wasn't quite sure he understood because he didn't seem surprised or anything.

Josh wanted to buy a fan for the apartment since there is no air conditioning at the house. We looked at them at Best Buy but they were all pretty expensive, 90$ for small fans since they were fancy brands. He wanted more of a standard fan so we decided to look somewhere else.

Still without power, we wanted to stay out and walk around to get a feel for the rest of our area. We decided to walk from Acoxpa to Mega, a big grocery store across the street from our school campus.

Once we crossed the street from Acoxpa, and started walking towards Mega, a girl started talking to us about how she was doing a social experiment. We kept walking and she walked along side us. She said that she's conducting a social experiment and that we either had to give a kiss, a hug, or 5 pesos to her or her friend, which was a guy who walked off when she approached us. Josh gave her a hug after I explained to him what she was saying. She looked at me next and I simply said "Pass". She made a big "awwww" sound and we walked away from them. What an experience! I had never had something like that happen to me before while with Jessica.

We continued on our way to Mega, this time walking in the middle of the street. The streets near our house separated with a giant median filled with trees and a sidewalk. Sometimes there will be an area for children to play and benches to sit in the middle of that median. It is probably about 20 feet wide. As we walked, we continued talking in English and because of that, we were stopped by a man sitting on a bench. In English, he asked us where we're from. When we answered United States, he said he knew United States, but where. We told him Oklahoma and he said he'd been to Florida. He asked us if we liked Mexico, we both said we liked it and he asked why we came here. We told him we were here to study and he asked us what we were studying. After telling him that we're studying computers. He told us that we should study information and that we could make a lot of money. He explained what he meant is that we could figure out stock prices and figure out if someone should invest or not in a company. We told him we were more interested in programming, but I don't know if he really understood what we meant, because the language barrier was quite strong. I didn't try to to talk to him in Spanish, but before we left we learned his name was Raul.

We left Raul, and we made it to Mega now. We walked around a bit, looking for fans, and finally found some but there were no price tags on them. We didn't end up asking for help and went to leave. I got stopped by security and they asked me to open my backpack. Maybe since we didn't buy anything. I showed them the inside of my bag which was a roll of toilet paper and two water bottles. They let us leave.

We walked across the street so I could show Josh the campus and charge our phones some more. There is a tall wall surrounding the entire school and at each gate into the school there is a security guard checking identification. You must have a school-issued ID to enter. I talked to the guard and told him we had orientation tomorrow and that we were coming to look around. He told us he would let us in if we gave him our IDs. We traded our OSU ID cards for a badge that read "Visitante".

We went to the library and sat down, charging our phones while Josh talked to his mom and I talked to Jessica. She was out with her parents and we wanted to go see a movie with her but we weren't decided on what to go see. She said her dad wanted to go with us and he picked a movie, "Mio o de nadie." The english title is Unforgettable.

We couldn't go back to the apartment because it started to rain, and the movie was in 30 minutes, so we waited for Jessica and her family to finish eating at Chili's and they picked us up at school. We went to the movie theater Cinepolis at Acoxpa.

The power in the lobby of the movie theater was flickering because of the rain and so I was nervous that it might interrupt the movie, but we didn't have any problems.

I didn't like the movie at all. I really don't like the feeling the movie made me have. Basically the main guy's ex is super crazy and refuses to let her ex move on, but he wants to marry a new girlfriend. The crazy ex is doing terrible things to stop him.

When we came home to sleep, there was no power still. I texted Magaly and Lizbeth, and Lizbeth came to gave us a key to another apartment across the hall. That apartment had power for some reason, so we decided to sleep there for the night. I began to feel nauseous after we got home, so I laid down. Tomorrow is our mandatory orientation for the summer program we're taking at Tec. I set my alarm for 6:45, and we should be there by 9:00 to check in.
