Finally, the weekend is here. It is so nice to wake up in the apartment and have power, at last. I hope that this isn't a common problem at this apartment.

We only plan to stay here in this apartment for the summer, and during July we'll find a place we can rent for the rest of the year. We want to find a place that at least has two bathrooms in preparation for Jessica to move in :)

Truth be told, I slept in very late today. I woke up at 3 o'clock to my phone going off, it was Jessica calling wondering why I had slept so late. I don't know why I was so tired! Well, I had a good night of sleep at least.

When I left my room Josh talked about how he was starving, so I got ready and we went out for food. He really wanted to go to a burrito place near the school but it was not open. We walked through an outdoor market that they have during the weekend and Josh really loved it. It was the first time he'd been to a place like that.

I felt pretty cool being able to show him that, I wonder if that's how Jessica felt when she showed me. It really is interesting, because in the United States we don't have anything like the outdoor markets they have here. They sell food, fruits, vegetables, Blu Rays, games, clothes, pastries, and there are little restaurants where they make you food. The best thing all is the price! They are super cheap.

After walking through the market we walked through a giant crowd of people waiting outside of a high school. Kids were receiving results for an entrance exam into UNAM, a big university in Mexico. The median area was marked off with police tape and there were police blocking the roads.

Since the burrito place was open, we were going to go to Tok's, a sit-down restaurant near the campus. However, it seemed really busy after we approached the doors. We picked instead to go to Panda Express. It was exactly like in the United States.

A dog laid down outside of the restaurant and we were worried about it. Josh thought that it might belong to the people next to us, so I asked them and they said no. After we found that out we gave it our leftovers, but it didn't seem interested in them.

We headed back home, lo' and behold! It was Raul again. This time he was sitting down, and wearing a different shirt (for the first time). He pointed to the bench across from him and told us to sit down he had some questions for us. Josh told him we were in a hurry. He got up and walked with us a bit and asked us about some bands we hadn't heard of. Then he asked about Aretha Franklin and I said yes, I'd heard of her. I don't listen to her, but my mom does. Then he changed the subject to Donald Trump. He told me that Donald Trump has "made him like the blacks". He said that instead of doing what hes doing and saying what he is saying all he needed to do was go on TV and tell the Mexican people "we don't have jobs here for our people, don't come here, there are no jobs".

This conversation was not what I wanted to talk about at all, I could tell Raul was deeply offended about it and getting upset, but I really didn't know what to tell him. I didn't vote for Donald Trump and I don't understand him either. Josh and I both assured him of that, and Raul said bye. He seemed upset.

We went home and spent an uneventful day.

Josh played Final Fantasy on his Xbox while I talked with Jessica and wrote up these blogs.

Tomorrow we plan to go outside of Mexico City to go four wheeling. Can't wait!
