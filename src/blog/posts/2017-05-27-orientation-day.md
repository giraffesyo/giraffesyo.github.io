Today was the first day that I will go to school "officially"! I woke up at about 7:15 when Josh knocked on my door. I had overslept my alarm and it had been going off for about 30 minutes, probably very annoyingly to our neighbors since it is so loud. We slept in the other apartment because it had power. I was relieved to be able to wake up with a charged phone and to be able to turn on some lights.

I didn't feel sick at all, so I was glad that it was over so easily.

Jessica originally planned to go with us to school but she wasn't up yet. Since we still had until 9 we weren't in any hurry. I showered at the apartment we slept at and Josh went over to our apartment and showered. It was super convenient to have two apartments at that moment, since we had access to two bathrooms.

We got ready for school, packed a water bottle and our laptops, and began walking to school. About half-way, Josh reminded me that we needed our Passports and FMM. We had to turn back to get them. It was about 8:30 at this point and we still had a little bit of time to get to the school.

Luckily, today we didn't run into anybody on the way to school. On our way I showed Josh some street vendors where they sell snacks, but told him it's more likely to get sick if he eats from these places.

We approached the security and I explained to the guard that we had an orientation today. He asked for our ID and I handed him my passport. It seemed apparent that they were going to keep it so I traded him my OSU ID for my passport since I still needed my passport for the orientation.

After getting past security we went up to the auditorium and there was a table setup where people from the school were waiting on us. One of them led Josh, some others, and I to the copy room in order to make copies of our FMM and passport. They asked me for 50 cents to make the copy but I didn't have any change so a girl that came with us paid for us. I overheard her talking and it seems that girl was Mexican, and it turns out she was on a national exchange for her "study abroad" trip instead of actually going to another country.![IMG_4355](https://mcquadeblog.files.wordpress.com/blog/2017/05/img_43551.jpg?w=169)

We headed back and received a folder to put our documents in which we'd turn in later. We still had about 20 minutes until we had to be in the auditorium for the presentation so we quickly ran over to the cafeteria and bought some food. The food in the cafeteria was very cheap. Josh and I both ate for just over 2$ total. He had 3 pancakes and I had some chilaquiles with beans.

We headed into the auditorium and were told about the absolute necessity of being on time and not missing class. If we miss more than 2 times or are late more than 5 minutes twice, we will fail.

We got our schedules for intermediate spanish and tae kwon do. The class starts at 8:00 AM Monday - Thursday. This will really be a challenge since I'm normally not a morning person!

After orientation was over we ran ahead of everyone else to the building with the offices to get our IDs printed before everyone![IMG_4358](https://mcquadeblog.files.wordpress.com/blog/2017/05/img_4358-e1495952031615.jpg?w=150) else lined up. I was the first person and got my ID immediately. So did Josh. We went back and filled out some paperwork for next week's trip to Teotihuacan and then were free for some time until the lunch.

They served us tacos and rice. Neither was very good. After lunch they put some stuff that looked like bird food in the middle of the table, also not that good, it tasted burnt. We left there and followed the group around campus. Sadly, the gym was not going to be available during the summer since it was having renovations done.

After the tour, we went with Jessica to Costco to buy some things. I bought some sheets for the bed and was tempted to buy a big thing of chips, but abstained. Her parents dropped us off at our house and we went to go get a change of clothes so we could get ready for the graduation party of Jessica's friend Tito. We arrived and the locks had been changed so I texted Lizbeth to have her unlock it and we got some new keys.

![IMG_4351](https://mcquadeblog.files.wordpress.com/blog/2017/05/img_4351-e1495952364223.jpg?w=300)We left the apartment and walked to the main street to take an uber to Jessica's house, and someone tapped Josh on the shoulder. It was Raul again! He said hi and talked for a moment about if we went to school. We told him we were all done for the day. He left as our uber pulled up, we were amazed to have seen him again. We ubered over to Jessica's and watched Moana with her and then headed out to the party!

![IMG_4372](https://mcquadeblog.files.wordpress.com/blog/2017/05/img_4372.jpg?w=169)The party was interesting indeed. They served many different dishes. The food was not to *any* of our tastes. It was what I would consider, I guess, "fancy food". The first dish was like a hamburger except instead of bread, meat and cheese, the buns were mushrooms, the cheese (was some cheese), and the meat was a tomato. :<![IMG_4373](https://mcquadeblog.files.wordpress.com/blog/2017/05/img_4373.jpg?w=169)

We stayed for a while and wanted to dance some, but we didn't want Josh to feel left out so we stayed at the table and talked. There was a live band which made me want to dance, even though I have no idea what I would be doing! Ha.

At 12:30, Jessica's parents brought us to the street. We signaled an uber and it was right in front of our car so we switched cars and  went back home. I asked the driver to drop us at a 711 so we could get some water first, then we went back home and went to sleep, ready for relaxing on our weekend.
